# Spring Cloud 的子项目介绍

Spring Cloud 由以下子项目组成。

## Spring Cloud Config


Centralized external configuration management backed by a git repository. The configuration resources map directly to Spring `Environment` but could be used by non-Spring applications if desired.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config>。

## Spring Cloud Netflix
Integration with various Netflix OSS components (Eureka, Hystrix, Zuul, Archaius, etc.).

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix>。

## Spring Cloud Bus
An event bus for linking services and service instances together with distributed messaging. Useful for propagating state changes across a cluster (e.g. config change events).

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-bus>。

## Spring Cloud for Cloud Foundry
Integrates your application with Pivotal Cloudfoundry. Provides a service discovery implementation and also makes it easy to implement SSO and OAuth2 protected resources, and also to create a Cloudfoundry service broker.

## Spring Cloud Sleuth
Distributed tracing for Spring Cloud applications, compatible with Zipkin, HTrace and log-based (e.g. ELK) tracing.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth>。

## Spring Cloud Data Flow
A cloud-native orchestration service for composable microservice applications on modern runtimes. Easy-to-use DSL, drag-and-drop GUI, and REST-APIs together simplifies the overall orchestration of microservice based data pipelines.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow>。

## Spring Cloud Stream
A lightweight event-driven microservices framework to quickly build applications that can connect to external systems. Simple declarative model to send and receive messages using Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ between Spring Boot apps.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream>。

## Spring Cloud Stream App Starters
Spring Cloud Stream App Starters are Spring Boot based Spring Integration applications that provide integration with external systems.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters>。

## Spring Cloud Task
A short-lived microservices framework to quickly build applications that perform finite amounts of data processing. Simple declarative for adding both functional and non-functional features to Spring Boot apps.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task>。

## Spring Cloud Task App Starters
Spring Cloud Task App Starters are Spring Boot applications that may be any process including Spring Batch jobs that do not run forever, and they end/stop after a finite period of data processing.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config>。

## Spring Cloud Zookeeper
Service discovery and configuration management with Apache Zookeeper.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task-app-starters>。

## Spring Cloud for Amazon Web Services
Easy integration with hosted Amazon Web Services. It offers a convenient way to interact with AWS provided services using well-known Spring idioms and APIs, such as the messaging or caching API. Developers can build their application around the hosted services without having to care about infrastructure or maintenance.

项目地址为：<https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-aws>。

## Spring Cloud Connectors
Makes it easy for PaaS applications in a variety of platforms to connect to backend services like databases and message brokers (the project formerly known as "Spring Cloud").

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config>。

## Spring Cloud Starters
Spring Boot-style starter projects to ease dependency management for consumers of Spring Cloud. (Discontinued as a project and merged with the other projects after Angel.SR2.)

项目地址为：<https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors>。

## Spring Cloud CLI
Spring Boot CLI plugin for creating Spring Cloud component applications quickly in Groovy

项目地址为：<https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-cli>。

## Spring Cloud Contract
Spring Cloud Contract is an umbrella project holding solutions that help users in successfully implementing the Consumer Driven Contracts approach.

项目地址为：<http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract>。
